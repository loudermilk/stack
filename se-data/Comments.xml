If e.g. your data is (0,0,+), (0,1,-), (1,0,-), (1,1,+) and you use the linear kernel, then there exists no SVM that has 100% accuracy. But what the program does that is responsible for finding the &quot;optimal&quot; SVM is an entirely different question. This is a nontrivial optimization problem."
